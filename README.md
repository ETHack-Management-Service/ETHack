### Greeting strangers... 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will introduce your mind to the concepts of underground hack'n chaos... Chaos, more often reside deep in the shadow's and shall not be awaken... Withal periodically it is necessary to invert the natural elements and the "chaos" must be enforced...


### Concepts

ETHack is simply a guide letting you understand how you should have fun, while hacking and creating opportunities for a community to grow together... Hacking in itself is not a negative definition, if used in the right context or for good, it can be exploited and many will, or can benefits out of it. Being a "Hacker", can mean many things, or have more than one denotation. Our goal is to create educational content, where curious minds or imagination and intuitiveness, will cooperate in an adventure to find the secret "hidden" divine artifact, or the holy grail...

This is a build-in progress as various "level's" will be put in place gradually. The answer, reside in itself... What's important is that, not the answer, but how you find it, or "you" having fun while doing so. Each participants or user, hackers, use or follow a different route and might encounter or experiment unalike process than you do. This, is the true magical operation of being a hacker, we each by our own have the same goal, but will use a different path or strategy to achieve it. 

If you are curious, you can easily find the community, send us a DM or reach out...
